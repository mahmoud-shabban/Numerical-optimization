# Numerical Algorithms and Numerical optimization 
Implementation of algorithms used in numerical optimization for ML and DS <br/>
In this course i have studied and implemented alot of numerical algorithms used in ML & DL models training<br/>
some of this algorithms: <br/>
 &emsp;1-Gradient decents and its variants(Batch - mini batch - stochastic) <br/>
  	&emsp;2- Momentum Based GD<br/>
  	&emsp;3- Nesetrov Accelerated GD (NAG)  <br/>
 	&emsp;4- Adaptive Gradient (Adagrad)<br/>
 	&emsp;5- RMS Prop<br/>
 &emsp;6- Adaptive Momentum (ADAM)<br/>
